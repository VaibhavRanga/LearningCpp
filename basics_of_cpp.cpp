//include (a.k.a. pre-processor directive) means import and iostream is a header file that contains definition of cin, cout etc. 
//But there are multiple definitions of cout and cin etc in iostream.
//Namespace is a portion/ segment of code. We define that the definition of cout and cin that has to be used lies in the std (standard) namespace block.

//bool      - 1
//char      - 1 or 2 or 4
//short     - 2
//int       - 4
//long      - 8
//float     - 4
//double    - 8
